# Prusik

Prusik is just a type of backup knot used in climbing. The name was chosen for this little experiment because it sounded cool and is easy to say.

# What it's used for

This passes through the [relay](https://github.com/mudclimber/relay) daemon as an experiment.

The idea behind this is to show you how easy it is to take a TCP endpoint and point it to the Hub for
Twitch authentication for free!
